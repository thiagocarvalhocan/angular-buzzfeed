ASYNC FUNCTION:

1- An async function always returns a Promise
2- For async functions, a non-promise return value is wrapped in a promise automatically.
3- 'await' key word pauses an async function until another promise is complete.
4- Await will either:
*give a result/value of a fulfilled promise
*throw an exception from a rejecte promise
5- Await is only valid to use inside an Async Function
